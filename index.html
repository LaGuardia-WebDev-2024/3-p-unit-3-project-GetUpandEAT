    <h2 class="col1">1. Preface</h2>
    <p>
      I really didn't know what to make this website about. I don't cook. I've
      never read a recipe in my life. My parents won't even let me touch the
      stove. Normally I'd make a website about something interesting that's
      going on in my life but there's nothing! My friends are always busy, my
      back hurts for some reason (not enough to make a website about it though),
      and I never have time to do the things I enjoy. So here's a website about
      <strong>a little bit of nothing</strong> (Whoa! That's the title!)
    </p>

    <h2 class="col1">3. My TBR List</h2>

    <p>
      For those of you that don't know, "TBR" stands for "To Be Read" and is a
      list of books that you'd like to read sometime soon. "Sometime soon" could
      mean right after you finish your current book, or it could mean months in
      the future when you're finally in the mood. I'm often the latter. Here's
      my list at the moment (in no particular order, again, I have to be in the
      exact right mood to even consider picking up any of these books from the
      library, let alone read them).
